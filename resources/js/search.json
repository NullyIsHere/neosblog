It's a pre-packaged set of tools and resources that allows even relatively unskilled individuals to launch sophisticated phishing attacks.","Essentially, it's a shortcut to cybercrime. Forget coding a fake login page from scratch or figuring out how to send mass emails. A phishing kit provides everything you need, ready to deploy."]},{"l":"The Anatomy of a Scam-in-a-Box","p":["So, what's inside this box of digital deceit?
